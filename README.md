# Leap Years 

I've been using this to practice my TDD process. 

A simple tool that will tell you whether a year is a leap year, according to the following rules:

* All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)

* All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years)

* All years divisible by 4 and not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g. 2004, 2008 and 2012 were leap years)

* All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2009, 2010 and 2011 were not leap years)

## Ruby's Date Library

I learned that Ruby has an inbuilt date library which you can use to check if a year is a leap year which is pretty cool.
